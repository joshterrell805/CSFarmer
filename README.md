## Community-Supported Farmer

This is a prototype of a website to help farmers sell food locally. It is currently viewable at https://csfarmer.net

I believe local food is beneficial in a multitude of ways, and I'd like to see more of it. However, I've decided to focus my professional capacity into regenerative agriculture, as my time is limited.

I'm working with someone now who is considering taking this project over. Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in contributing or getting more info.
